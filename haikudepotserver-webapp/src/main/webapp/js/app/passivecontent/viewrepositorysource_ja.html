<p>
    The repository source defines a URL from which repository data can be obtained.
    There are often multiple URLs for a repository, one for each architecture.

    Alongside the actual repository data, there is also a <code>repo.info</code> file
    with a <code>url</code> field.  This is a unique identifier for that actual
    repository source.  This is the key that marries-up the HDS data with the
    repository in the client HaikuDepot desktop application.
